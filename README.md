# RT File Manager

Acronym tbd

## Ideas

- Transparent archives
- Spinners while directory is loading
- Nearby share integration
- MacOS style Proxies
- Search vs Filter (just type = Filter in current directory + startswith ranked higher, Ctrl+F = Search recursively)
- Keyboard only nav
- Grouping like MacOS / Explorer
- New Nautilus style pathbar
    - Clicking slashes triggers Ctrl+L
    - Clicking directory navigates
- Command pallete
- Status bar
- Home screen with recent files, favorites, disks, etc.
    - PC Info (hostname, etc?)
- File history (btrfs? custom snapshots?)
- Rightclick -> Share (SMB, SFTP, Mail, Phone, )
- MacOS like "Services", e.g. encode video, make qr code, etc.
- Space used for disks
- Greyed out but persistent extensions
- Search/Smart folders (used for tags)
- Devices (KDE Connect integration)
